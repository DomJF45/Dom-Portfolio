### About Me

My Name is Dom and I am a software developer from Kennesaw GA. I have a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from Kennesaw State University (KSU) and I am currently a Masters candidate in the Masters in Software Engineering program at KSU as well. My interest in software development began with programming cognitive-neuropsychological tasks in C++ which are essentially just simple video games. Eventually, I came to realize that I really enjoyed programming and problem solving. I then took some courses in programming and fell in love.

### My Work

Currently, I work at the Neuropsychology of Emerging Adults, Addiction, Recovery, and Related Disorders Lab @ KSU. My daily work includes creating full-stack cognitive neuropsychological tasks that are administered through the participants personal browser. Some of these experiments are currently ongoing, so I cannot provide the link due to data contamination.
