### New Site

I finally made a portfolio site For a long time, I have thought about creating one. Now I have finally done it, and I couldn't be happier with it. This website was a great challange for me to not only learn the Next.JS framework and further my understanding of React, but to overhaul my CSS skills as well. Normally, I use Bootstrap as I am not familiar with CSS, however I feel that relying on technologies like Bootstrap are counterintuitive and only hold yourself back creatively and technically. This website was based off of <u>[https://uzu.works/](https://uzu.works/)</u> and was built entirely with CSS and by referencing this website. I did not look at the source code for this website and instead decided to put my CSS knowledge to the test by attempting to recreate it

### Thoughts on Next.JS

Overall, I really like Next.JS. The notable features for me are the routing and API calls. In regard to the Routing, it is a lot more straightforward and less headache inducing than using react-router. It's nice to be able to quickly create a route and not have to dig through react-router's documentation due to all the syntax changes. Regarding the API, I think it is a cool feature for lightweight webapps. I might or might not use this feature in an upcoming project because I think a backend and client side are necessary, so depending on the level of intricacy the project is I might consider using Next's in house API.

### Future Directions

Would I use Next.JS in the future? For small projects, definitley. However for bigger projects, I think it is imperitive to use the standard React library as you can customize the library according to your project needs. One of the things I've noticed about Next.JS is you have to do things in the Next.JS-way which can limit creativity.
